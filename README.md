# Java-Banking-System
**This is my first complete Java application that I built while learning Object-Oriented Programming concepts!**

What I Learned Through This Project

**1. Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals**
   
**--> Encapsulation:** Used private fields with public getters/setters to protect data

**--> Inheritance:** Created a class hierarchy (Data → Operation → User)

**--> Code Reusability:** Extended functionality through inheritance instead of rewriting code

**2. Java Core Concepts**

a. Class and object creation

b. Constructor usage and method overriding

c. Scanner class for user input

d. Switch-case for menu-driven programs

e. Random number generation for account numbers

**3. Practical Programming Skills**
   
i. How to structure a real-world application

ii. Input validation and error handling

iii. Creating user-friendly console interfaces

iv. Problem-solving through code organization

**4. Project Features**

--> Automatic 8-digit account number generation

--> Account creation with user details

--> Balance checking and display

--> Deposit and withdrawal operations

--> Account details viewing

--> Menu-driven interface
