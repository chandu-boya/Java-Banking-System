# Java-Banking-System
**This is my first complete Java application that I built while learning Object-Oriented Programming concepts!**

**What I Learned Through This Project**

**1. Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals**
   
**--> Encapsulation:** Used private fields with public getters/setters to protect sensitive customer data

**--> Inheritance:** Created a class hierarchy (Operation → User) with proper method overriding

**--> Data Hiding:** Implemented private access modifiers to protect internal class implementation

**--> Code Reusability:** Extended functionality through inheritance instead of rewriting code


**2. Java Core Concepts**

a. Class and object creation

b. Constructor usage and method overriding

c. Scanner class for user input

d. Switch-case for menu-driven programs

e. Random number generation for account numbers


**3. Practical Programming Skills**
   
**I. Real-World Application Structure:** Built a complete banking system mimicking real financial operations

**II. Input Validation:** Implemented balance checks and withdrawal validations

**III. User-Friendly Interface:** Designed clear console prompts and formatted output displays

**IV. Problem-Solving:** Addressed logical flow issues in menu navigation and data persistence


**4. Project Features**

**-->** Automatic 8-digit account number generation

**-->** Account creation with user details

**-->** Balance checking and display

**-->** Deposit and withdrawal operations

**-->** Account details viewing

**-->** Menu-driven interface


**5. Customer Data Fields Handled**

**Full Name**

**Date of Birth (DD/MM/YYYY)**

**Gender**

**Aadhaar Number**

**Mobile Number**

**Complete Address**

**PIN Code**

**Account Number (Auto-generated)**

**Account Balance (Default: ₹0.0)**


**6. Project Structure**

**BankingSystem/**

**├── User.java          # Base class with customer data and getters/setters**

**├── Operation.java     # Banking operations (extends User)**

**└── BankAPP.java       # Main class with user interface and menu system**
